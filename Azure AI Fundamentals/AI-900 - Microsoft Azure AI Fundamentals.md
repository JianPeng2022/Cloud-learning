Which natural language processing (NLP) workload is used to generate closed caption text for live presentations?  
**Azure AI Speech**
conversational language understanding (CLU)
question answering models
text analysis
_Azure AI Speech provides speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities through speech recognition and synthesis. You can use prebuilt and custom Speech service models for a variety of tasks, from transcribing audio to text with high accuracy to identifying speakers in conversations, creating custom voices, and more._

Which type of machine learning algorithm groups observations is based on the similarities of features?
classification
**clustering**
regression
supervised
_Clustering algorithms group data points that have similar characteristics. Regression algorithms are used to predict numeric values. Classification algorithms are used to predict a predefined category to which an input value belongs. Supervised learning is a category of learning algorithms that includes regression and classification, but not clustering._

You need to identify numerical values that represent the probability of humans developing diabetes based on age and body fat percentage.
Which type of machine learning model should you use?
hierarchical clustering
linear regression
**logistic regression**
multiple linear regression
_Multiple linear regression models a relationship between two or more features and a single label. Linear regression uses a single feature. Logistic regression is a type of classification model, which returns either a Boolean value or a categorical decision. Hierarchical clustering groups data points that have similar characteristics._

Which type machine learning algorithm predicts a numeric label associated with an item based on that item’s features?
classification
clustering
**regression**
unsupervised
The regression algorithms are used to predict numeric values. Clustering algorithms groups data points that have similar characteristics. Classification algorithms are used to predict the category to which an input value belongs. Unsupervised learning is a category of learning algorithms that includes clustering, but not regression or classification.

An electricity utility company wants to develop a mobile app for its customers to monitor their energy use and to display their predicted energy use for the next 12 months. The company wants to use machine learning to provide a reasonably accurate prediction of future energy use by using the customers’ previous energy-use data.
Which type of machine learning is this?
classification
clustering
multiclass classification
**regression**
_Regression is a machine learning scenario that is used to predict numeric values. In this example, regression will be able to predict future energy consumption based on analyzing historical time-series energy data based on factors, such as seasonal weather and holiday periods. Multiclass classification is used to predict categories of data. Clustering analyzes unlabeled data to find similarities present in the data. Classification is used to predict categories of data._
