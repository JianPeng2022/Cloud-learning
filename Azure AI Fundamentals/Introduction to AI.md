Microsoft Azure provides the **Azure Machine Learning service** - a cloud-based platform for creating, managing, and publishing machine learning models. Azure Machine Learning Studio offers multiple authoring experiences, such as:
- **Automated machine learning**: this feature enables non-experts to quickly create an effective machine learning model from data.
- **Azure Machine Learning Designer**: a graphical interface enabling no-code development of machine learning solutions.
- **Data metric visualization**: analyze and optimize your experiments with visualization.
- **Notebooks**: write and run your own code in managed Jupyter Notebook servers that are directly integrated in the studio.

Computer vision:
- Image classification: Image classification involves training a machine learning model to classify **images** based on their **contents**.
- Object detection: Object detection machine learning models are trained to classify individual objects **within an image**, and identify their location with a **bounding box**.
- Semantic segmentation: Semantic segmentation is an advanced machine learning technique in which **individual pixels**('mask') in the image are classified according to the object to which they belong.
