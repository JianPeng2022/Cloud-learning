Microsoft Azure provides the **Azure Machine Learning service** - a cloud-based platform for creating, managing, and publishing machine learning models. Azure Machine Learning Studio offers multiple authoring experiences, such as:
- **Automated machine learning**: this feature enables non-experts to quickly create an effective machine learning model from data.
- **Azure Machine Learning Designer**: a graphical interface enabling no-code development of machine learning solutions.
- **Data metric visualization**: analyze and optimize your experiments with visualization.
- **Notebooks**: write and run your own code in managed Jupyter Notebook servers that are directly integrated in the studio.

Computer vision:
- Image classification: Image classification involves training a machine learning model to classify **images** based on their **contents**.
- Object detection: Object detection machine learning models are trained to classify individual objects **within an image**, and identify their location with a **bounding box**.
- Semantic segmentation: Semantic segmentation is an advanced machine learning technique in which **individual pixels**('mask') in the image are classified according to the object to which they belong. 
- Image analysis: You can create solutions that combine machine learning models with advanced image analysis techniques to extract information from images, including "tags" that could help catalog the image or even descriptive captions that summarize the scene shown in the image.
- Face detection, analysis, and recognition: Face detection is a specialized form of object detection that locates human faces in an image. This can be combined with classification and facial geometry analysis techniques to recognize individuals based on their facial features.
- Optical character recognition (OCR): Optical character recognition is a technique used to detect and read text in images. You can use OCR to read text in photographs (for example, road signs or store fronts) or to extract information from scanned documents such as letters, invoices, or forms.
