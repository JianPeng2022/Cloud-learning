### Computer vision 
To a computer, an image is an **array of numeric pixel** values. An array consists of seven rows and seven columns, representing the pixel values for a 7x7 pixel image (which is known as the image's **resolution**分辨率).

The array of pixel values for this image is two-dimensional (representing rows and columns, or x and y coordinates) and defines a single rectangle of pixel values. A single layer of pixel values like this represents a grayscale image. In reality, most digital images are multidimensional and consist of three layers (known as channels) that represent red, green, and blue (**RGB**) color hues.
