The metrics described above are commonly used to evaluate a regression model. In most real-world scenarios, a data scientist will use an iterative process to repeatedly train and evaluate a model, varying:
- Feature selection and preparation (choosing which features to include in the model, and calculations applied to them to help ensure a better fit).
- Algorithm selection (We explored linear regression in the previous example, but there are many other regression algorithms)
- Algorithm parameters (numeric settings to control algorithm behavior, more accurately called hyperparameters to differentiate them from the x and y parameters).
- After multiple iterations, the model that results in the best evaluation metric that's acceptable for the specific scenario is selected.
